      <p>
        Apartament Cobogó was a renovation project with the architect Juliana
        Mendes. The first thing we did was to open up the living area by
        removing a non-load-bearing wall, which instantly made the space feel
        more airy and light. From there, we focused on bringing in natural
        elements to create a cozy and inviting atmosphere. We wanted to create a
        space that was not only beautiful, but also functional and comfortable
        for everyday living.
