      <p>
        Ampla is a Brazilian health insurance company that caters specifically
        to young customers. In order to effectively communicate the brandâ€™s core
        values of modernity, energy, and minimalism, I developed a series of
        social media posts that capture the essence of these concepts. My aim
        was to create content that resonates with the target audience and
        conveys the message that Ampla is a contemporary and dynamic health
        insurance provider that truly understands the needs of young people.
